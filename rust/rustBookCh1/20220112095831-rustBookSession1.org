* troubleshooting some of the rust install stuff for both me and matt
* I made a nix shell following this template, in the "installation via rustup" part
 [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Rust][rust template on nixos iwki]] 
* got things to print hello world using nix shell
* seeing whether it works with emacs
  after running and adding direnv allow, I got error
  #+begin_example
    error: 'rls' is not installed for the toolchain 'nightly-2021-09-19-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'
    To install, run `rustup component add rls --toolchain nightly-2021-09-19-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

    Process rls stderr finished

  So, will try installing rustup in the nix-shell imperatively by running the command.
  - [ ] how would I add this declaratively to the nix-shell? well, I haven't loked at it veyr much yet
  - ok, so that seems to have worked
* commands that are useful in emacs
 =spacemacs/rust-quick-run= runs the boyo by rustc instead of compiling it
* rustfmt
  auto-formatting tool that can make ur code pretty if u want n stuff
* <2022-01-13 Thu 11:13> Matt wasn't available this morning because he was sick, so I worked on this myself aka made sure it worked w emacs
* <2022-01-13 Thu 11:12> After a lot of messing around, I've confirmed that cargo works well enough in emacs just by using the 'cargo x' commands by ~shell-command~
  - going through ch01-03
  - ~cargo build, cargo run, cargo check~ build the thing, run the thing, and confirm that it will build without building it respectively
  - ~cargo build --release~ will build the code with optimizations
