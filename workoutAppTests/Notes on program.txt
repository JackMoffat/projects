Ab Workout Plan Parameters Meso 1: Eights, Week 1: Accumulation, Day 1 - 4


-----General Plan Parameters-----

-Main exercises are bench, squat, military press, and pullup.

-your working max is what you will be basing your work off of throughout these phases. to get your working max go to https://exrx.net/Calculators/OneRepMax and figure out your 
1 rep max based off of recent numbers ( lower reps are more accurate for example a 5 rm better than a 30 rm), then multiply that number by 0.95.

-Rest times are given in minutes, ex. 1.25 min = 75 seconds.
-Every workout, the last set of your MAIN exercise (only!) is done for beyond the given reps, it's usually good to take a longer rest before this last set.

-While using light-ish weights and trying to build strength, the most important things are building strong form and VELOCITY.
	-being able to hit 5 concentrically explosive reps while staying with strong form and stability will keep you safer and make you able to lift more in the long run.
	-the speed of the movement causes extra muscle fiber recruitment 


Reps remaining:

in the first week of a mesocycle (Accumulation), you want to make sure that for all of your assistance exercises and for the last set of your main exercises
you stay 2-3 reps away from failure. For example, if you're using a weight that would be your 10 rep max, you would do 7 or 8 rep


Main exercise Parameters:

Intensity =  65% of WORKING MAX
Sets =  [8]
Reps =  [5, 'max']
Rest =  [1.25, 4]
Reps remaining =  ['2-3']

This looks like:
[Calculated 1 rep max] x [0.95] = [Working max (W.M)]
[W.M] x [0.65] = Your target weight for that main exercise.

You will do 8 sets of 5+ reps with that weight. the first 7 sets will be for 5 reps only and with 75 seconds rest, before the last set you will take 3-4 min rest
and then do the same weight for as many reps as you can until you are 2-3 reps away from failure.


Assistance exercise parameters:

The format for these exercises is [sets], [reps], [rest(min)]
